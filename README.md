# brain-region-segmentation
Brain Region Segmentation System using a custom YOLOv9-based architecture that implements a patch fusion strategy to handle high-resolution (4096x4096) brain images. The model processes images using multi-scale patch decomposition and fusion to accurately segment 25 distinct brain regions, enabling detailed neuroanatomical analysis.
